    3-SUM in quadratic time.

    Design an algorithm for the 3-SUM problem that takes time
    proportional to n2 in the worst case. You may assume that
    you can sort the n integers in time proportional to n2 or
    better.

    Search in a bitonic array.

    An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of
    integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers.
    Write a program that, given a bitonic array of n distinct integer
    values, determines whether a given integer is in the array.

    Standard version: Use ∼3lg(n) compares in the worst case.
    Signing bonus: Use ∼2lg(n) compares in the worst case (and prove that
                   no algorithm can guarantee to perform fewer than ∼2lg(n)
                   compares in the worst case).

    Egg drop.

    Suppose that you have an n-story building (with floors 1 through n)
    and plenty of eggs. An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor T or
    higher and does not break otherwise. Your goal is to devise a
    strategy to determine the value of T given the following limitations
    on the number of eggs and tosses:

    Version 0: 1 egg, ≤T tosses.
    Version 1: ∼1lg(n) eggs and ∼1lg(n) tosses.
    Version 2: ∼lg(T) eggs and ∼2lg(T) tosses.
    Version 3: 2 eggs and ∼2n tosses.
    Version 4: 2 eggs and ≤cT tosses for some fixed constant c.
